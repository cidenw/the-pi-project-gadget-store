<h2>What is The PI Project?</h2>
	The PI Project, established on May 19,2017, is an e-shopping platform that is designed to help its consumers and buyers find their electronic needs in a whim. Likewise, the TPP also cares for its retailers and sellers such that we made sure that we close affordable yet 'win-win' deals. The TPP chose to venture online gadget selling because we believe that the need for electronic devices is fast-rising along with the technology and industry itself. We envision the future along the ranks of the known online shopping stores such as Lazada and Amazon and we see a stunning world with you!

It is a big-deal for us to make sure that transactions made under our service are safe, efficient, and worthwhile. We make sure that even how busy you are, wherever, whenever, you`ll get the latest and top-trend gadgets of the time!
