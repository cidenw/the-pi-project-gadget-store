<h4 style="font-size: 20px;">
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The PI Project, established on May 19,2017, is an e-shopping platform that is designed<br>
	 to help its consumers and buyers find their electronic needs in a whim. Likewise, the TPP also cares <br>
	 for its retailers and sellers such that we made sure that we close affordable yet 'win-win' deals. <br>
	 The TPP chose to venture online gadget selling because we believe that the need for electronic devices<br>
	  is fast-rising along with the technology and industry itself. We envision the future along the ranks<br>
	   of the known online shopping stores such as Lazada and Amazon and we see a stunning world with you!
