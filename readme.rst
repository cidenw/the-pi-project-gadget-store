Release Information
*******************

This repo contains in-development code for future releases.

Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************
Installation
************

Upload the CodeIgniter folders and files to your server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root.
